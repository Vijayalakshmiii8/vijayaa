# Realtime project
This project i made at my bachelor's degree period to complete my degree in computer science.
i used to create this project with help of php,javascript,css,html and also use SQL for backend
Me and my partner were create this project for the owner of the wedding hall as a real time project.
The major feauture we done on that project,if the hall was available for customer needed date,
they only put date and check the availablity and then they book the hall for the date.
And also we give backend for owner of the mahal as admin page for confirm and delete their
booking to customer.
